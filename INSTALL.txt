INSTALLATION

	1. 
	Unzip lib/glm-0.9.9.2.zip
	This should create the directory "lib/glm-0.9.9.2/" within the solution directory.

	2.
	Install Qt5.15 LTS with msvc2019_64 compiler support

	3.
	Define QTDIR as a Windows environment variable, and make it target the Qt binaries:
		Example: QTDIR = C:\DEV\lib\Qt\Qt5.15\5.15.0\msvc2019_64
		
	3. 
	Run Visual Studio 2019.
	Install the QtVSTools extension from within VS.
	Restart VS.
	Go to the Extensions menu and hover on Qt Vs Tools, then in the drop down menu select Qt Options.
	Add an entry: name it as you wish (eg., msvc2019_64_qt5.15) and select the Qt toolchain (eg., C:\DEV\lib\Qt\Qt5.15\5.15.0\msvc2019_64) to use.

	4. 
	Restart Visual Studio and load the AppPlanetSubdiv solution.
	Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer panel and select "Change Solution Qt's Version", then select the entry you created in step 3.

	Everything should be good from now.

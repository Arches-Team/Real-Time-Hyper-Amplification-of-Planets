## üõ† Installation

1. **Unzip GLM Library**  
   Unzip `lib/glm-0.9.9.2.zip`.  
   This should create the directory `lib/glm-0.9.9.2/` within the solution directory.

2. **Install Qt 5.15 LTS**  
   Download and install **Qt 5.15 LTS** with `msvc2019_64` compiler support.

3. **Set up Environment Variable**  
   Define a Windows environment variable `QTDIR` pointing to the Qt binaries:  

   QTDIR = C:\DEV\lib\Qt\Qt5.15\5.15.0\msvc2019_64


4. **Configure Visual Studio 2019**  
- Run Visual Studio 2019.  
- Install the **Qt Visual Studio Tools** extension from within Visual Studio.  
- Restart Visual Studio.  
- In the `Extensions` menu, go to `Qt VS Tools` ‚Üí `Qt Options`.  
- Add a new Qt version entry (e.g., `msvc2019_64_qt5.15`) and set the path to your Qt installation (e.g., `C:\DEV\lib\Qt\Qt5.15\5.15.0\msvc2019_64`).

5. **Load the Solution**  
- Restart Visual Studio and load the `AppPlanetSubdiv` solution.  
- In Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution and select `Change Solution Qt's Version`.  
- Choose the Qt version entry you created in step 4.

The project should now be ready to build and run.

	abstract = {We propose an original method for generating planets with a high level of detail in real time. Our approach relies on a procedural hyper-amplification algorithm: a controlled subdivision process that faithfully reproduces landforms and hydrosphere features at different scales. Starting from low-resolution user-defined control maps providing information about the elevation, the presence of large-scale water bodies and landforms types, we apply subdivision rules to obtain a high-resolution hydrologically consistent planet model. We first generate large-scale river networks connected to inner seas and oceans and then synthesize the detailed hydrographic landscapes, including river tributaries and lakes, mountain ranges, valleys, plateaus, deserts and hills systems. Our GPU implementation allows to interactively explore planets that are produced by tectonic simulations, generated procedurally or authored by artists.},
